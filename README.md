The primary challenge is to enhance restaurant services and customer satisfaction by leveraging insights from high-demand cuisines and top-rated restaurants. While the dataset indicates a general consistency in average restaurant ratings across different types, certain cuisines—particularly North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food—play a significant role in driving higher ratings. Additionally, premium dining options with higher average costs tend to receive better customer reviews.

However, many restaurants do not offer these high-demand cuisines or premium dining experiences, limiting their potential to attract a broader customer base. To remain competitive and increase customer engagement, the goal is to identify restaurants lacking these popular cuisines and premium services and implement targeted improvements. This requires:

Identifying the restaurants not offering top-rated cuisines.
Adding high-demand cuisines like North Indian and Chinese to these restaurants.
Elevating dining experiences through premium options, including menu refinement, improved service, and enhanced features like online ordering and table booking.
The objective is to bridge the gap between customer preferences and existing restaurant offerings, driving better ratings and expanding the reach of premium dining establishments.
